## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Risks

- **Centralization Risk**: The contract owner has administrative privileges
- **Oracle Dependency**: Relies on external price feeds for order execution
- **Front-running**: Bots may compete for order execution
- **MEV**: Order execution may be subject to MEV attacks

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Access Controls**: Proper owner and executor authorization
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All external functions protected
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **State Validation**: Order existence and ownership checks

### Audit Status

- **Static Analysis**: Aderyn analysis completed
- **Code Review**: Internal review completed
- **External Audit**: Not yet completed

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Verify contract addresses before interacting
- Monitor your orders and execution status
- Use reputable executor services
- Understand gas costs and network conditions

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement proper access controls
- Use established libraries (OpenZeppelin)
- Conduct thorough testing
